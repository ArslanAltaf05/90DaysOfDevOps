```ls -ltr```
The command `ls -ltr` in Linux is used to list the files and directories in a directory, and display them in a detailed format (-l option) and order them by modification time in reverse order (-t option) and reverse order (-r option).


File Permission
File permissions are a way to control who can access and make changes to files and directories on a Linux system. These permissions determine who can read, write, and execute a file, and are an essential aspect of security and privacy on Linux systems.

There are three types of file permissions: read, write, and execute. The read permission allows a user to view the contents of a file, the write permission allows a user to make changes to a file, and the execute permission allows a user to run a file as a program.


ACL 
ACL stands for Access Control Lists, and it is a mechanism that allows you to set fine-grained permissions on files and directories in Linux. Unlike traditional file permissions, which only allow you to set permissions for the owner, group, and others, ACLs allow you to set permissions for specific users and groups.
